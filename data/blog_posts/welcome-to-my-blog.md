# Welcome to My Blog!

Hello and welcome to my technical blog! I'm excited to share my journey in technology, programming, and data science with you.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be sharing:

- **Technical tutorials** on Python, Flask, and web development
- **Data science insights** and machine learning projects
- **Project walkthroughs** explaining how I built various applications
- **Career experiences** and lessons learned as a Computer Science student
- **Tips and tricks** for aspiring developers

## Why I Started This Blog

As a Computer Science student passionate about Python and Data Science, I believe in the power of sharing knowledge. This blog serves multiple purposes:

1. **Documentation**: Recording my learning journey and projects
2. **Teaching**: Helping others who are on similar paths
3. **Portfolio**: Showcasing my technical writing and expertise
4. **Community**: Connecting with fellow developers and data scientists

## Recent Projects

I've been working on some exciting projects lately, including:

- **Brain Tumour Classifier**: A machine learning system for medical image analysis
- **Audio Conversion Tool**: A PyDub-based application for audio processing
- **This Portfolio Website**: Built with Flask for dynamic content management
